**🌐 Web Server using Docker**

This project demonstrates how to containerize a web server with Docker as part of my DevOps internship at CodeAlpha. It highlights the power of containers in simplifying deployments, ensuring consistency across environments, and providing an efficient way to run web applications.

**🔑 Key Features**

Fully containerized web server for hosting static web content

Lightweight and portable, runs seamlessly on any system with Docker

Simple, beginner-friendly structure showcasing Docker fundamentals

Scalable foundation for future DevOps and cloud-based projects

**🛠️ Technologies**

Docker – for containerization

Nginx / Apache HTTP Server – as the web server

HTML, CSS, JavaScript – for static website content

**📂 Project Overview**

The project is structured to clearly separate the Docker configuration from the application files.

A Dockerfile defines the image for the web server

Static web content (HTML, CSS, JS) is served by the container

The container maps ports to allow external access to the application

**🎯 Objectives**

Gain practical experience with Docker images and containers

Learn how to deploy and manage a web server using containers

Understand port mapping, isolation, and portability

Build a foundation for CI/CD and cloud deployments

**📸 Demonstration**

When the container is running, the web server delivers the static website to users through the browser.
(You can include a screenshot of your webpage here to make it visually appealing.)

**📖 Learning Outcomes**

By completing this project, I learned how to:

Write and use Dockerfiles effectively

Build and run containers for real-world applications

Serve web content from a containerized environment

Apply containerization concepts to DevOps practices
